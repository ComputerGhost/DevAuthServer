# Fake Authorization Server

This is a fake authorization server.
It is great for initial development for projects that require OAuth.
Of course, it will be replaced before going to Prod, right?

## Warnings

Do not use this in production.
Do not even use this as a starting point for a proper auth server.
There are bugs and security holes that I'm ignoring.
Any of this code going into a production build is just asking to be hacked.

## Solutions for Prod

FusionAuth - It's good if you don't need much customization.  Customization costs money.

Keycloak - This looks promising and free.
